"about-me-text": "Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m <1>Ambar Gorgon</1>, a FrontEnd Developer and Programming Technician from Argentina. <br> I studied web and mobile design and development with a focus on <1>React</1>, and later completed a Programming degree, which allowed me to broaden my perspective towards <1>backend and databases</1>.<br><br> I especially enjoy shaping interfaces and turning ideas into clear and usable digital experiences. At the same time, thanks to my training, I can contribute to project planning, documentation, and architecture, always aiming for the most efficient solution.<br><br> Beyond programming, I make music â€” a facet that, just like coding, inspires me to work in teams and keep creativity alive. <br><br>If you have a project in mind, Iâ€™d love to hear about it and think together about how to bring it to life.",
